A simple .NET webpage that displays data from https://data.gov.lv/ API in a jquery DataTable (that enables paging, searching, sorting). Export to CSV was also added.
It is possible to add more data to be displayed just by adding a link in the sidebar and type, resourceId and description in dataGovTypes.json.
It was made in less than two days and ChatGPT was used to help with making this.
